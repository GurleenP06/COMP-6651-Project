    "##### Implementation:\n",
    "To update the distance (v.g) and predecessor (v.π) attributes for every node in the graph, the algorithm essentially performs a breadth-first search (BFS), beginning at the source node s. Finding the shortest routes between the source and every other node in the graph is the objective. The source node is used by the algorithm to initialise a priority queue. Nodes that are close to the source are found and added to the queue during the first iteration. In the following iterations, the algorithm searches its neighbouring nodes for the node with the lowest value, extracts it from the queue, and, in the event that v.g > u.g + 1, executes the RELAX operation. Until all pertinent nodes have been processed, this process keeps going."
