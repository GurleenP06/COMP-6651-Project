# COMP-6651-Project

_Comparative Study of Algorithms for Computing Augmenting Paths to Maximum Flow Problem_

The project focuses on comparing four such algorithms: Random, DFS-like, Maximum Capacity (MaxCap), and Shortest Augmenting Path (SAP). Each algorithm is tested under different network conditions – varying numbers of nodes, edge weights, and capacity constraints – to evaluate their efficiency in finding augmenting paths. The performance metrics include the number of paths found, average path lengths, and the total edges visited. The aim is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in different scenarios.

The project file consists of two folders: Simulations 1 & Simulations 2. Each folder consists of an executable .ipynb file which can be executed using Anaconda's Jupyter or any Python IDE, and the graphs that were generated for the given condidtions and are saved as a CSV file having 3 parameters - Source, Destination, Capcity.
